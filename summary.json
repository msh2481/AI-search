"The reviewed documents cover various aspects of cognitive improvement and intervention strategies across different age groups and conditions, focusing on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in older adults, and the general improvement of cognitive functions through different means.\n\n1. A study on pediatric ADHD found that a digital, AI-driven cognitive stimulation therapy led to improvements in inhibitory control, visuospatial working memory, cognitive flexibility, and general executive functioning. These improvements were associated with increases in alpha-band power in brain regions involved in the default mode network.\n\n2. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia revealed that cognitive training interventions improved overall attention, selective attention, divided attention, and global cognitive function, though with relatively low effectiveness. Incorporating attention function training into routine activities could help delay the deterioration of attention function.\n\n3. Research on noninvasive brain stimulation combined with cognitive training (NIBS-CI) showed positive effects on overall cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnesic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), but limited effects on memory functions. This suggests NIBS-CI could be a valuable treatment option, although more robust studies are needed.\n\n4. An investigation into children born to teenage mothers showed that IQ scores improved from ages 6 to 10, with factors like maternal cognitive ability, school grade, ethnicity, and caregiver education being significant predictors of higher IQ scores. Stability of maternal custody was linked to these improvements.\n\n5. Training in executive attention shown that preschool children can activate the executive attention network more efficiently and quickly after training, with effects lasting up to two months. Training also transferred to improvements in fluid intelligence and regulation of affect.\n\n6. A study on children with developmental dyslexia highlighted the role of personal conceptions of intelligence (incremental vs. entity) on the efficacy of a multidimensional intervention program aimed at improving decoding abilities and working memory.\n\n7. A quasi-experimental study on older adults demonstrated that Cognitive Stimulation Intervention improved cognitive function, self-efficacy, and happiness significantly compared to a control group.\n\n8. Literature reviews and studies covered the impact of various interventions on intelligence, the plasticity of intellectual development, the association between socioeconomic status and genetic effects on adult intelligence, and strategies for managing cognitive frailty and enhancing social and interoceptive mental training's effects on brain function and structure.\n\n9. Short-term music training was found to enhance verbal intelligence and executive function in preschool children, showcasing the potential for early cognitive skill development through music.\n\n10. Several studies focused on older adults, suggesting that interventions ranging from cognitive stimulation to multimodal lifestyle interventions can improve cognitive function, daily function, and even slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. \n\n11. Another noteworthy finding was that learning to read could potentially improve intelligence over time in identical twins, emphasizing the significant environmental influence on intellectual development.\n\n12. The efficacy of community-based early education programs on infants' intelligence development was also tested, with results indicating significant improvements in the intervention group compared to controls.\n\nIn summary, these documents collectively show promising results in cognitive improvement across the lifecycle through various interventions, including digital cognitive stimulation, cognitive training, noninvasive brain stimulation, lifestyle changes, and early education programs. They underscore the importance of tailored interventions that consider personal, social, and environmental factors to enhance cognitive functions and overall well-being."
