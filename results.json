  "Electrophysiological Brain Changes Associated With Cognitive Improvement in a Pediatric Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Digital Artificial Intelligence-Driven Intervention: Randomized Controlled Trial.\nCognitive stimulation therapy appears to show promising results in the rehabilitation of impaired cognitive processes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nEncouraged by this evidence and the ever-increasing use of technology and artificial intelligence for therapeutic purposes, we examined whether cognitive stimulation therapy implemented on a mobile device and controlled by an artificial intelligence engine can be effective in the neurocognitive rehabilitation of these patients.\nIn this randomized study, 29 child participants (25 males) underwent training with a smart, digital, cognitive stimulation program (KAD_SCL_01) or with 3 commercial video games for 12 weeks, 3 days a week, 15 minutes a day. Participants completed a neuropsychological assessment and a preintervention and postintervention magnetoencephalography study in a resting state with their eyes closed. In addition, information on clinical symptoms was collected from the child\u00b4s legal guardians.\nIn line with our main hypothesis, we found evidence that smart, digital, cognitive treatment results in improvements in inhibitory control performance. Improvements were also found in visuospatial working memory performance and in the cognitive flexibility, working memory, and behavior and general executive functioning behavioral clinical indexes in this group of participants. Finally, the improvements found in inhibitory control were related to increases in alpha-band power in all participants in the posterior regions, including 2 default mode network regions of the interest: the bilateral precuneus and the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex. However, only the participants who underwent cognitive stimulation intervention (KAD_SCL_01) showed a significant increase in this relationship.\nThe results seem to indicate that smart, digital treatment can be effective in the inhibitory control and visuospatial working memory rehabilitation in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Furthermore, the relation of the inhibitory control with alpha-band power changes could mean that these changes are a product of plasticity mechanisms or changes in the neuromodulatory dynamics.\nISRCTN Registry ISRCTN71041318; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN71041318.",
  "The effect of cognitive training on domains of attention in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\nAttention is essential to daily life and cognitive functioning, and attention deficits can affect daily functional and social behaviour, such as falls, risky driving, and accidental injuries. However, attention function is important yet easily overlooked in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, and evidence is limited. We aimed to explore the pooled effect of cognitive training on domains of attention in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia using a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.\nWe searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to 3 November 2022. We included participants aged \u226550 years diagnosed with cognitive impairment, with various cognitive training interventions as the intervention measures. The primary outcome was overall attention and the secondary outcomes were attention in different domains and global cognitive function. We calculated the Hedges' g and confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model to evaluate the effect size of the outcome measures and evaluated heterogeneity using the \u03c7\nWe included 17 RCTs and found that cognitive training interventions improve overall attention (Hedges' g\u2009=\u20090.41; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.13, 0.70), selective attention (Hedges' g\u2009=\u20090.37; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.19, 0.55), divided attention (Hedges' g\u2009=\u20090.38; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.03, 0.72), and global cognitive function (Hedges' g\u2009=\u20090.30; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.02, 0.58) in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, but with relatively low effectiveness.\nCognitive training intervention can improve some attention functions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Attention function training should also be incorporated into routine activities and long-term sustainability planning to delay the deterioration of attention function in older adults. Besides reducing their risk of abnormal events in daily life (such as falls), it can also improve their quality of life and help reduce the progression of cognitive impairment, achieving early detection of secondary prevention.\nPROSPERO (CRD42022385211).",
  "The Therapeutic Effects of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation Combined with Cognitive Training in Elders with Alzheimer's Disease or Amnesic Mild Cognitive Impairment.\nRecent studies have indicated that noninvasive brain stimulation combined with cognitive interval (NIBS-CI) improved cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Amnesic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI). While previous interventions have demonstrated that a single targeted cognitive intervention can improve cognitive function, the outcomes of using both interventions simultaneously are less well-established. Therefore, this study aims to perform a meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of NIBS-CI in treating cognitive impairment associated with AD and a-MCI, with the goal of obtaining novel insights into this combined intervention.\nPubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest and Central Cochrane library databases were searched up to December 2022. The primary cognitive outcomes were extracted from the included article. A mean difference (MD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval were calculated by using random-effect models.\nTwelve studies with a total of 587 AD patients were included. The findings demonstrated that NIBS-CI significantly improved cognitive function of AD patients in cognitive outcomes (SMD = -0.52, 95%CI (-0. 93, -0.11)) and ADAS-COG (MD = -1.16, 95%CI (-1.69, -0.63)). The pooled results showed that NIBS-CI did not improve cognitive function of AD patients in short-time memory (SMD = 0.057, 95%CI (-0.13, 0.25), P = 0.56) and long-time memory (SMD = 0.001, 95%CI (-0.20, 0.20), P = 0.99).\nThere is evidence for a positive effect of NIBS-CI on overall cognitive function of AD and a-MCI. Considering the limited sample size, it is important to interpret the findings related to memory with caution. To obtain more robust results, future studies should be conducted with larger sample sizes and incorporate objective neurophysiological and neuroimaging tools. These methodological enhancements will allow for a better understanding of the therapeutic targets and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the effects of NIBS-CI treatment.",
  "Improvement in intelligence test scores from 6 to 10 years in children of teenage mothers.\nThis study investigates change in IQ scores among 290 children born to teenage mothers and identifies social, economic, and environmental variables that may be associated with change in intelligence test performance.\nThe children of 290 teenage mothers (72% African-American and 28% European American) were assessed with the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale-4th Edition at ages 6 and 10.\nThe mean composite score at age 6 was 84.8 and 91.2 at age 10, an improvement of 6.4 points. Significant cross-sectional predictors at both ages 6 and 10 of higher Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale scores were maternal cognitive ability, school grade, white ethnicity, and caregiver education. Having more children in the household significantly predicted lower Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale scores at age 6. Higher satisfaction with maternal social support predicted higher Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale scores at age 10. Change in IQ scores was not related to maternal socioeconomic status, social support, home environment, ethnicity, or family interactions. Custodial stability was associated with an improvement in IQ scores, whereas increase in caregiver depression was related to decline in IQ scores.\nOur findings suggest that improvement in IQ scores of offspring of teenage mothers may be related to stability of maternal custody. More research is needed to determine the impact of the maturation of adolescent mothers' parenting and the role of early education on improvement in cognitive abilities.",
  "Enhanced efficiency of the executive attention network after training in preschool children: immediate changes and effects after two months.\nExecutive attention is involved in the regulation of thoughts, emotions and responses. This function experiences major development during preschool years and is associated to a neural network involving the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal structures. Recently, there have been some attempts to improve attention and other executive functions through training. In the current study, a group of 5 years old children (n=37) were assigned to either a training-group who performed ten sessions of computerized training of attention or a non-trained control group. Assessment of performance in a range of tasks, targeting attention, intelligence and regulation of affect was carried out in three occasions: (1) before, (2) after, and (3) two months after completion of training. Also, brain function was examined with a high-density electroencephalogram system. Results demonstrate that trained children activate the executive attention network faster and more efficiently than untrained children, an effect that was still observed two months after without further training. Also, evidence of transfer of attention training to fluid intelligence and, to a lesser degree, to regulation of affect was observed. Results show that efficiency of the brain system underlying self-regulation can be enhanced by experience during development, providing opportunities for curricular improvement.",
  "Investigating the Improvement of Decoding Abilities and Working Memory in Children with Incremental or Entity Personal Conceptions of Intelligence: Two Case Reports.\nOne of the most significant current discussions has led to the hypothesis that domain-specific training programs alone are not enough to improve reading achievement or working memory abilities. Incremental or Entity personal conceptions of intelligence may be assumed to be an important prognostic factor to overcome domain-specific deficits. Specifically, incremental students tend to be more oriented toward change and autonomy and are able to adopt more efficacious strategies. This study aims at examining the effect of personal conceptions of intelligence to strengthen the efficacy of a multidimensional intervention program in order to improve decoding abilities and working memory. Participants included two children (M age = 10 years) with developmental dyslexia and different conceptions of intelligence. The children were tested on a whole battery of reading and spelling tests commonly used in the assessment of reading disabilities in Italy. Afterwards, they were given a multimedia test to measure motivational factors such as conceptions of intelligence and achievement goals. The children took part in the T.I.R.D. Multimedia Training for the Rehabilitation of Dyslexia (Rappo and Pepi, 2010) reinforced by specific units to improve verbal working memory for 3 months. This training consisted of specific tasks to rehabilitate both visual and phonological strategies (sound blending, word segmentation, alliteration test and rhyme test, letter recognition, digraph recognition, trigraph recognition, and word recognition as samples of visual tasks) and verbal working memory (rapid words and non-words recognition). Posttest evaluations showed that the child holding the incremental theory of intelligence improved more than the child holding a static representation. On the whole this study highlights the importance of treatment programs in which both specificity of deficits and motivational factors are both taken into account. There is a need to plan multifaceted intervention programs based on a transverse approach, considering both cognitive and motivational factors.",
  "Pilot testing cognitive stimulation intervention on older adults' cognitive function, cognitive self-efficacy, and sense of happiness.\nWith the ageing population increasing worldwide, identifying effective approaches to counteract cognitive decline becomes significant for maintaining cognitive health and quality of life in older adults. The lack of cognitive activity accelerates age cognitive decline. Cognitive stimulation interventions can maintain older adults' cognitive reserve, enhance their feelings of happiness, and potentially improve their psychosocial wellbeing.\nThis study aimed to determine the impact of Cognitive Stimulation Intervention on older adults' cognitive function, cognitive self-efficacy, and sense of happiness.\nA quasi-experimental methodological approach was applied. Two seniors' clubs were the sites for recruitment in this study as part of the Alexandria Governorate's Ministry of Social Solidarity, Egypt. Eighty older adults (aged 60 and above), randomly assigned into two equal groups. The study group received the study intervention, and the control group received regular seniors' club services.\nCognitive function, cognitive self-efficacy, and sense of happiness scores among the study group, were significantly increased from (22.40 \u00b1 0.67, 54.51 \u00b1 8.63 and 27.68 \u00b1 14.0 respectively) to (24.30 \u00b1 1.07, 87.84 \u00b1 4.96 and 65.98 \u00b1 8.90 respectively) (P < 0.001) following the interventions, and were significantly higher than the control group's post-test percent scores (22.08 \u00b1 0.98, 54.35 \u00b1 6.97, and 28.75 \u00b1 9.60 respectively) (P < 0.001).\nCognitive Stimulation Intervention effectively fostered the older adults' cognitive function, cognitive self-efficacy, and sense of happiness. Consequently, seniors' clubs, care homes, and other contexts seeking to apply Cognitive Stimulation Intervention to improve older adults' cognitive function, and general wellbeing must embed this intervention as part of their routine care and social activities programs.",
  "Improving intelligence: a literature review.\nIntelligence is associated with performance on a wide range of cognitive tasks and is a reliable predictor for educational and professional success. Therefore, the development of effective training regimens that aim to improve intelligence is of high interest. In recent years, there has been accumulating evidence that certain interventions have a positive impact on intelligence. The aim of the present paper is to provide a literature review on such studies. Despite promising results, we conclude that there are still many unknown variables and that the mechanisms that underlie improvements in intelligence are not well understood. More work is needed in order to disentangle these involved processes and to further refine existing training regimens.",
  "Functional and microstructural plasticity following social and interoceptive mental training.\nThe human brain supports social cognitive functions, including Theory of Mind, empathy, and compassion, through its intrinsic hierarchical organization. However, it remains unclear how the learning and refinement of social skills shapes brain function and structure. We studied if different types of social mental training induce changes in cortical function and microstructure, investigating 332 healthy adults (197 women, 20-55 years) with repeated multimodal neuroimaging and behavioral testing. Our neuroimaging approach examined longitudinal changes in cortical functional gradients and myelin-sensitive T1 relaxometry, two complementary measures of cortical hierarchical organization. We observed marked changes in intrinsic cortical function and microstructure, which varied as a function of social training content. In particular, cortical function and microstructure changed as a result of attention-mindfulness and socio-cognitive training in regions functionally associated with attention and interoception, including insular and parietal cortices. Conversely, socio-affective and socio-cognitive training resulted in differential microstructural changes in regions classically implicated in interoceptive and emotional processing, including insular and orbitofrontal areas, but did not result in functional reorganization. Notably, longitudinal changes in cortical function and microstructure predicted behavioral change in attention, compassion and perspective-taking. Our work demonstrates functional and microstructural plasticity after the training of social-interoceptive functions, and illustrates the bidirectional relationship between brain organisation and human social skills.\nNavigating daily life requires a number of social skills, such as empathy and understanding other people\u2019s thoughts and feelings. Research has found that specific parts of the brain support these abilities in humans. For instance, the brain areas that support compassion are different from the regions involved in understanding other people\u2019s perspective and thoughts. It is unclear how learning and refining social skills alters the brain. Previous studies have shown that learning new motor skills restructures the areas of the brain that regulate movement. Could acquiring and improving social skills have a similar effect? To investigate, Valk et al. trained more than 300 healthy adults in different social skills over the course of three months as part of the ReSource project. The program was designed to enhance abilities in compassion and perspective through mental exercises and working in pairs. Participants were also trained using different approaches to see whether changes to the brain are influenced by how a skill is learnt. The brains of the participants were repeatedly pictured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This revealed that different types of training caused unique changes in specific parts of the brain. For example, teaching mindfulness made parts of the brain less functionally connected, whereas training to understand other people\u2019s thought increased functional connections between various regions. These functional alterations were paralleled by changes in brain structure. They could also predict improvements in social skills which were measured throughout the study using behavioural tests. These findings suggest that training can help to improve social skills even in adults, which may benefit their quality of life through stronger social connections. Better knowledge of how to develop social skills and their biological basis will help to identify people who need support with these interactions and develop new therapies to nurture their abilities.",
  "Short-term music training enhances verbal intelligence and executive function.\nResearchers have designed training methods that can be used to improve mental health and to test the efficacy of education programs. However, few studies have demonstrated broad transfer from such training to performance on untrained cognitive activities. Here we report the effects of two interactive computerized training programs developed for preschool children: one for music and one for visual art. After only 20 days of training, only children in the music group exhibited enhanced performance on a measure of verbal intelligence, with 90% of the sample showing this improvement. These improvements in verbal intelligence were positively correlated with changes in functional brain plasticity during an executive-function task. Our findings demonstrate that transfer of a high-level cognitive skill is possible in early childhood.",
  "Is an intervention program necessary in order to improve economically disadvantaged children's IQ scores?\nThe hypothesis was investigated that alleviation of negative motivational factors underlies much of the 10-point IQ increase commonly found in economically disadvantaged children's performance following a preschool intervention program. Head Start and non-Head Start groups were tested on IQ and motivational measures 3 times before and during the Head Start year (pretest, retest, posttest). Both groups showed comparable IQ gains on retesting, but only the Head Start group showed continued gain from retest to posttest. Parallel changes were found on a motivational measure of wariness of an unfamiliar examiner. The test-retest improvement of both groups was interpreted as resulting from increased familiarity with the testing situation. The continued improvement of the Head Start children was interpreted as reflecting changes in the children's motivational structures as a result of attending a preschool intervention program.",
  "[A study on factors contributing to intelligence in 857 children].\nTo study the main environmental factors affecting intelligence of children.\nIntelligence quotients (IQ) were examined in 857 pupils of grades 1 to 6 in a primary school and categorized into four different classes. Data of relevant environmental factors were collected with questionnaires. Uni-variate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors influencing their IQ.\nThere were 27 factors with statistical significance in uni-variable analysis. And, then they were analyzed with stepwise logistic regression method. Six variables, i.e., parents' education level, breast feeding during infancy, early education at home, nutritional status before three years old, single parent family and average scores at school, enter the regression model finally.\nIntelligence development in children was affected by a lot of factors, and good acquired environmental factors, especially their early nutrition, family background and education, would benefit for their intelligent development and improvement of their intelligent ability in children.",

Secondary outcomes included cognitive functions, anxiety, and depression.\nSeventeen participants completed the intervention; 4 missed the follow-up. The generalized estimating equations model showed significant changes from baseline to pretest (control) and pretest to posttest (intervention) on the ADLQ (p = .014) and CMT-delayed (p = .003). Effects remained at the 16-wk follow-up. After adjusting for the effects of covariates, the self-reported daily function of participants ages \u2264 63 yr improved more than that of other participants (p = .003).\nMulticomponent cognitive interventions integrating LR techniques may improve self-reported daily function and context-dependent memory function of adults with SCD, with efficacy sustained at follow-up.

  "The effects of oral iron supplementation on cognition in older children and adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nIn observational studies anaemia and iron deficiency are associated with cognitive deficits, suggesting that iron supplementation may improve cognitive function. However, due to the potential for confounding by socio-economic status in observational studies, this needs to be verified in data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs).\nTo assess whether iron supplementation improved cognitive domains: concentration, intelligence, memory, psychomotor skills and scholastic achievement.\nSearches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL and bibliographies (to November 2008). Inclusion, data extraction and validity assessment were duplicated, and the meta-analysis used the standardised mean difference (SMD). Subgrouping, sensitivity analysis, assessment of publication bias and heterogeneity were employed.\nFourteen RCTs of children aged 6+, adolescents and women were included; no RCTs in men or older people were found. Iron supplementation improved attention and concentration irrespective of baseline iron status (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.90) without heterogeneity. In anaemic groups supplementation improved intelligence quotient (IQ) by 2.5 points (95% CI 1.24 to 3.76), but had no effect on non-anaemic participants, or on memory, psychomotor skills or scholastic achievement. However, the funnel plot suggested modest publication bias. The limited number of included studies were generally small, short and methodologically weak.\nThere was some evidence that iron supplementation improved attention, concentration and IQ, but this requires confirmation with well-powered, blinded, independently funded RCTs of at least one year's duration in different age groups including children, adolescents, adults and older people, and across all levels of baseline iron status.",
  "Tomato and lemon extracts synergistically improve cognitive function by increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in aged mice.\nBrain ageing, the primary risk factor for cognitive impairment, occurs because of the accumulation of age-related neuropathologies. Identifying effective nutrients that increase cognitive function may help maintain brain health. Tomatoes and lemons have various bioactive functions and exert protective effects against oxidative stress, ageing and cancer. Moreover, they have been shown to enhance cognitive function.

  "Effects of mind-body exercise on cognitive performance in middle-aged and older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis study.\nTo systematically evaluate the clinical efficacy of physical and mental exercise on cognitive performance in middle-aged people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nComputer searches of PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature Service, Wanfang database, China Knowledge Network, and VIP full-text database of Veep journals were conducted to obtain clinical randomized controlled trials on physical and mental exercise interventions in middle-aged and elderly people with MCI. The literature was screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the final included literature was subjected to data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4.1 software, and publication bias test was performed using stata17.0 software.\nA total of 27 publications with a total of 2565 cases of elderly people with MCI were included. The control group was conventional care, health education, or blank control, and the physical and mental exercise group was exercises including Tai Chi, dance, orthopraxia, and qigong for 30 to 90 minutes each time, 3 to 6 times per week, for a total duration of 8 to 36 weeks. Meta-analysis results showed that Montreal cognitive assessment scores (mean difference [MD] = 2.33, 95% CI [1.55, 3.10], P < .00001), the mini-mental state examination score (MD = 1.73, 95% CI [0.60, 2.86], P = .003), trail making test-A score (MD = -4.00, 95% CI [-6.75, -1.25], P = .004), trail making test-B score (MD = -18.46, 95% CI [-23.87, -13.06], P < .00001), global deterioration scale score (MD = -0.72, 95% CI [-1.09, -0.34], P = .0002), Wechsler Logical Memory Scale score (MD = 2.07, 95% CI [0.03, 4.10], P = .05), berg score (MD = -0.70, 95% CI [0.32, 1.07], P < .0003), cerebrospinal fluid Tau protein level (MD = -166.69, 95% CI [-196.93, -136.45], P < .00001), and cerebrospinal fluid levels of \u03b1\u03b21-42 protein (MD = 180.39, 95% CI [134.24, 226.55], P < .00001).\nMind-body exercise can improve cognitive performance, depressive status, and balance as well as increase \u03b1\u03b21-42 protein levels and decrease Tau protein levels in middle-aged and older adults with mild cognitive impairment.",
  "The plasticity of intellectual development: insights from preventive intervention.\nDebates regarding the plasticity of intelligence are often fired by a confusion between 2 distinct realms of development, that is, between developmental functions (e.g., a group's average IQ over time) and individual differences (e.g., the relative rank ordering of individual IQs within a group). Questions concerning the stability of these 2 realms are statistically independent. Thus there are 2 kinds of intellectual plasticity, and there may be no developmental convergences between them. In the present study, data from an early intervention program were used to investigate the 2 kinds of plasticity separately and to examine certain possible convergences between them. The program involved children at risk for developmental retardation who were randomly assigned at birth to 2 rearing conditions (i.e., educational daycare vs. no educational intervention) and whose intellectual development was then studied longitudinally to 4 years of age. Our findings indicate that developmental functions are moderately alterable through systemic early education, particularly after infancy, whereas individual differences are moderately stable, again particularly after infancy. They also indicate that the 2 kinds of plasticity are independent; the alteration of developmental functions through daycare affects neither the stability nor the determinants of individual differences. We discuss the implications that these findings have for current models of mental development, for the nature-nurture debate, and for arguments concerning the efficacy of early intervention programs.",
  "Childhood socioeconomic status amplifies genetic effects on adult intelligence.\nStudies of intelligence in children reveal significantly higher heritability among groups with high socioeconomic status (SES) than among groups with low SES. These interaction effects, however, have not been examined in adults, when between-families environmental effects are reduced. Using 1,702 adult twins (aged 24-84) for whom intelligence assessment data were available, we tested for interactions between childhood SES and genetic effects, between-families environmental effects, and unique environmental effects. Higher SES was associated with higher mean intelligence scores. Moreover, the magnitude of genetic influences on intelligence was proportional to SES. By contrast, environmental influences were constant. These results suggest that rather than setting lower and upper bounds on intelligence, genes multiply environmental inputs that support intellectual growth. This mechanism implies that increasing SES may raise average intelligence but also magnifies individual differences in intelligence.",
  "Management of cognitive frailty: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\nWe aimed to compare the effectiveness of interventions in cognitive function and frailty status and rank these interventions.\nData Sources-We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CNKI, Wanfang, VIP and Google scholar. Data synthesis-The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk bias assessment tool. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Chi-square test and quantified by I\nA total of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1110 patients were included in our analysis. The network map of cognitive function comprised 9 RCTs with 1347 participants, examining eight different interventions. Nutritional support (SUCRA\u00a0=\u00a099.9%, SMD\u00a0=\u00a03.02, 95% CI: 2.53, 3.51) may be the most effective intervention to improve cognitive function. The network map of frailty (including 9 RCTs with 1017 participants and 9 interventions) suggested that multicomponent exercises (SUCRA\u00a0=\u00a096.4%, SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-5.10, 95% CI: -5.96, -4.23) tended to have a greater effect.\nCommunity-based multicomponent exercises have shown significant benefits for improving cognitive function and frailty status in older adults, with moderate certainty. For hospitalized older patients with Cognitive frailty (CF), current evidence suggests that nutritional support yields the most improvement. Additionally, aerobic exercise and dual-task training have proven effective in managing CF. Further studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings and exploring more accessible and effective physical and cognitive interventions to prevent CF in aging.",
  "Does learning to read improve intelligence? A longitudinal multivariate analysis in identical twins from age 7 to 16.\nEvidence from twin studies points to substantial environmental influences on intelligence, but the specifics of this influence are unclear. This study examined one developmental process that potentially causes intelligence differences: learning to read. In 1,890 twin pairs tested at 7, 9, 10, 12, and 16 years, a cross-lagged monozygotic-differences design was used to test for associations of earlier within-pair reading ability differences with subsequent intelligence differences. The results showed several such associations, which were not explained by differences in reading exposure and were not restricted to verbal cognitive domains. The study highlights the potentially important influence of reading ability, driven by the nonshared environment, on intellectual development and raises theoretical questions about the mechanism of this influence.",
  "Efficacy of multi-domain cognitive function training on cognitive function, working memory, attention, and coordination in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia: A one-year prospective randomised controlled trial.\nCognitive function, working memory, attention, and coordination are higher-level functions sharing a complex relationship. Limited evidence exists on the effectiveness of multi-domain cognitive function interventions to improve cognitive outcomes. We evaluated the effectiveness of such interventions on cognitive function, working memory, attention, and coordination in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia.\nWe conducted a double-blind, two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial in community care centres of Northern Taiwan. We recruited 72 participants aged\u226565 years and randomly allocated them using 1:1 block randomization (block size\u2009=\u20094) into experimental (multi-domain cognitive function training) (MCFT) and control groups (passive information activities) (PIA) (n\u2009=\u200936/group). We administered the interventions in both groups for 30 minutes per session, three sessions per week for eight weeks, for a total of 24 sessions. The outcome indicators were cognitive function assessed (mini-mental status examination), working memory (digit span), selective attention (Stroop test), visual-spatial attention (trail making test-A (TMT-A)), divided attention (trail making test-B (TMT-B)), and coordination (Berry visual-motor integration (Berry-VMI)). We evaluated the study outcomes at baseline, immediate post-test, one-month follow-up, and one-year follow-up.\nWe found no significant differences between the groups at baseline except for education. The average age of participants was 82.3 years, and most (76.4%) were female. We analysed the results by generalised estimating equations (GEE) based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The multi-domain cognitive function training was effective in improving cognitive function (\u03b2\u2009=\u20091.7; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.63-2.31; P\u2009=\u20090.001), working memory (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.45; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-2.62, -0.27; P\u2009=\u20090.016), and selective attention (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-23.3; 95%\u2009=\u2009CI -43.9, -2.76; P\u2009=\u20090.026) compared to passive information activities at 1-month follow-up.

There were no significant improvements in attention outcomes (visual-spatial and divided attention) after training.\nMCFT intervention demonstrated favourable effects in improving global cognitive function, working memory, selective attention, and coordination among older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia. Thus, applying multi-domain cognitive training in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia could help to delay the cognitive decline.\nChinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000039306).",
  "A Remotely Coached Multimodal Lifestyle Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease Ameliorates Functional and Cognitive Outcomes.\nComprehensive treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) requires not only pharmacologic treatment but also management of existing medical conditions and lifestyle modifications including diet, cognitive training, and exercise. Personalized, multimodal therapies are needed to best prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nThe Coaching for Cognition in Alzheimer's (COCOA) trial was a prospective randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a remotely coached multimodal lifestyle intervention would improve early-stage AD.\nParticipants with early-stage AD were randomized into two arms. Arm 1 (N\u200a=\u200a24) received standard of care. Arm 2 (N\u200a=\u200a31) additionally received telephonic personalized coaching for multiple lifestyle interventions. The primary outcome was a test of the hypothesis that the Memory Performance Index (MPI) change over time would be better in the intervention arm than in the control arm. The Functional Assessment Staging Test was assessed for a secondary outcome. COCOA collected psychometric, clinical, lifestyle, genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and microbiome data at multiple timepoints (dynamic dense data) across two years for each participant.\nThe intervention arm ameliorated 2.1 [1.0] MPI points (mean [SD], p\u200a=\u200a0.016) compared to the control over the two-year intervention. No important adverse events or side effects were observed.\nMultimodal lifestyle interventions are effective for ameliorating cognitive decline and have a larger effect size than pharmacological interventions. Dietary changes and exercise are likely to be beneficial components of multimodal interventions in many individuals. Remote coaching is an effective intervention for early stage ADRD. Remote interventions were effective during the COVID pandemic.",
  "Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial: Effect of an everyday cognition training program on cognitive function, emotional state, frailty and functioning in older adults without cognitive impairment.\nAgeing entails changes in complex cognitive functions that lead to a decrease in autonomy and quality of life. Everyday cognition is the ability to solve cognitively complex problems in the everyday world, enabling instrumental activities of life. Benefits have been found in studies using everyday cognition-based assessment and intervention, as the results predict improvements in everyday performance, not just in specific cognitive functions. A study protocol is presented based on assessment and training in everyday cognition versus traditional cognitive stimulation for the improvement of functionality, emotional state, frailty and cognitive function.\nA parallel randomised controlled clinical trial with two arms will be conducted. It will be carried out by the University of Salamanca (Spain) in eleven centres and associations for the elderly of the City Council of Salamanca. People aged 60 years or older without cognitive impairment will be recruited. Participants will be randomly distributed into two groups: the experimental group will undergo a training programme in everyday cognition and the control group a programme of traditional cognitive stimulation, completing 25 sessions over 7 months. All participants will be assessed at the beginning and at the end of the intervention, where socio-demographic data and the following scales will be collected: The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS), Questionnaire ARMS-e, Everyday Cognition Test (PECC), Scale Yesavage, Test Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), The Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Fragility Index and Lawton y Brody Scale.\nThe present study aims to improve conventional clinical practice on cognitive function training by proposing a specific assessment and intervention of everyday cognition based on the importance of actual cognitive functioning during the resolution of complex tasks of daily life, giving priority to the improvement of autonomy.\nClinicalTrials.gov; ID: NCT05688163.

  "[Study on the effect of a community-based early education and service program regarding intelligence development of infants].\nStudy on the effect of a community-based early education and service program regarding intelligence\nTo assess the effect on a community-based early education and service programs regarding the development of infants' intelligence.\nA community-based intervention study was carried out among 359 infants and their families. Base-line survey were carried out when infants reached their one month, where after infants and their families in the intervention group received instructions and services focused on baby fostering and intelligence development. When the infants reached their six-months and twelve-months of age, their families were informed to complete the follow-up surveys, using both questionnaire investigation and testing the infants' intelligence quotients. The infants' intelligence quotients were measured by Development Screening Test for children under six. By comparing intelligence quotients of infants in two study groups in the follow-up surveys, this paper evaluated the impacts of community intervention on the infants' intelligence development.\nDuring two follow-ups, no statistical difference had been detected between the two groups of infants in term of gender or delivery process. Baseline data showed that infants' mental index (MI) scored 98.26 in the intervention group and 101.79 in the control one, and development quotient (DQ) scored 94.50 and 99.36 in respective groups. Infants' MI score increased 6.07 and 8.86 at the six-month and twelve-month follow-up periods respectively in the intervention group compared during the baseline, higher than the MI increments of the control group at the two follow-up periods (-2.46 and 1.05 respectively). DQ score of infants in the intervention group increased 12.94 and 11.24 respectively in the two follow-up surveys, which were also higher than increments in the control group (-0.18 and 0.34). The group x time effect(interaction effect) of MI and DQ in six-month and twelve-month follow-ups were both significantly higher than that of the baseline level.\nThe community-based early education and service programs could effectively improve the infants' intelligence.",
  "Cognitive and functional evolution in older adults with and without intellectual disability using a multicomponent intervention: A prospective longitudinal study.\nThe global population is experiencing accelerated biopsychosocial aging. Cognitive impairment is frequently associated with functional impairment in basic and instrumental daily living activities. To maintain optimal cognitive and functional functioning, health professionals recommend that older adults participate in cognitive training.\nThis study examines the cognitive and functional evolution of older adults with and without Intellectual Disability and the factors associated with favourable evolution following the intervention of a multicomponent programme based on the human occupational model and the person-centred care model.\n247 people participated. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed to examine baseline data. The Wilcoxon paired samples test was used to compare cognitive and functional evolution one year after the intervention. Linear regression was used to detect factors predicting favourable evolution.\nBoth populations improved cognitively. There was no change in basic activities of daily living. There was an improvement in instrumental activities of daily living in the group with Intellectual Disability. None of the variables collected was a predictor of greater improvement.\nThis study demonstrated that older people with Intellectual Disability who have supports to cope with this life stage can improve their cognitive and functional abilities.",
  "How understanding and strengthening brain networks can contribute to elementary education.\nImaging the human brain during the last 35 years offers potential for improving education. What is needed is knowledge on the part of educators of all types of how this potential can be realized in practical terms. This paper briefly reviews the current level of understanding of brain networks that underlie aspects of elementary education and its preparation for later learning. This includes the acquisition of reading, writing and number processing, improving attention and increasing the motivation to learn. This knowledge can enhance assessment devices, improve child behavior and motivation and lead to immediate and lasting improvements in educational systems.",
  "Children's theories of intelligence: beliefs, goals, and motivation in the elementary years.\nThe authors tested a developmental model of children's theories about intelligence in kindergarten, second grade, and fourth grade children by using paper-and-pencil maze tasks. Older children were more likely than younger children to espouse learning goals (e.g., that they preferred difficult mazes to improve their skill), and less likely to espouse performance goals (e.g., that they preferred easy mazes to be successful). Children in all 3 age groups reported stronger beliefs in the malleability of intelligence than the stability of intelligence. In general, the results supported the authors' hypotheses about developmental change in children's theory-like conceptions of intelligence: Beliefs, goals, and motivation were related in expected ways for second and fourth graders more than for kindergartners. The authors discussed contextual influences on children's beliefs and the development of children's conceptualizations of intelligence.",
  "Cognitive stimulation and psychosocial results in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.\nCognitive stimulation (CS) is a popular and cost-effective intervention, which applies different types of techniques focused on cognitive skills and can be administered by different professionals. CS can be defined as activities that involve cognitive processing usually conducted in a social context and often in a group. Therefore, CS can improve psychosocial functioning and quality of life (QoL), depression, anxiety and activities of daily living (ADLs) independent of the pharmacological treatment such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of CS on psychosocial outcomes in older adults (aged 65 years or over), with healthy cognitive ageing, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia.\nPubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were examined from inception to October 2021. A total of 1,997 studies were initially identified in these databases. After discarding studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 30 studies were finally included in the systematic review and the meta-analysis performed with robust variance estimator (RVE) due the inclusion of studies with repeated measurements. The quality assessment tools from the National Institutes of Health were used to evaluate the quality of the studies.\nCS was significantly associated with a higher QoL in participants who received personalized/adapted CS (RVE\u00a0=\u00a00.11\u00b10.19 [-0.76, 0.99], t(1.86)\u00a0=\u00a00.6, p\u00a0=\u00a00.61). .\nPersonalized/adapted CS seems to improve QoL in older adults."
